# BeatSaber_SquatToBegin

Is shitmissing not frustrating enough for you, or do you simply need to improve your physique? Then Squat To Begin is just the right plugin for you!

Thanks to Sync for the amazing idea and thanks to Olaf my beloved for his voice ❤️

### Install

Click on [releases](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_SquatToBegin/releases/latest), download the dll from the latest release and place it in your plugins folder.

### Config

- Can set how many squats you need to do
- Can set how deep you need to squat
- Can set that you need to squat when unpausing
- Can set a non-100% trigger chance
- Can also count squats done mid-level :D

# Custom Sounds

You can replace or amend the builtin sounds of the plugin. Place your sound files (.ogg VORBIS) into these folders respectively:

- `UserData/SquatToBegin/ok` for the "Confirmation" Sound on every squat.
- `UserData/SquatToBegin/begin` for the Sound when asked to Squat.

Furthermore to fully replace / remove the builtin sounds, you can set `AppendBuiltinSounds` to false in the config, otherwise your custom sounds would be used in addition.
